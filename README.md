# My_Twitter_Data

My Twitter Data is an app that helps you to analyse your personal Twitter account without having to install any software in your machine. It is online and totaly free. If you don't have a Twitter account but still want to check the app's functionalities, don't worry! At the site I provide a mock data sample for you to play around with. 

I developed the app in python using the streamlit library, feel free to check the code and make a commit if you wish! There are several things to be improved, bellow you will find a TO DO list with all the improvements that I plan to do. Can you help me with it? Can you think about anything else?
